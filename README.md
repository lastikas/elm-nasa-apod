This project was created with the intention to learn [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

## Available scripts
In the project directory you can run:
### `elm-app build`

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `elm-app start`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
